## 0.9 (October 26, 2009)

### Updates that Require Changes in `xmonad.hs`

  * `XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops` no longer uses `layoutHook`, the
    `ewmhDesktopsLayout` modifier has been removed from
    xmonad-contrib. It uses `logHook`, `handleEventHook`, and
    `startupHook` instead and provides a convenient function `ewmh` to
    add EWMH support to a `defaultConfig`.

  * Most `DynamicLog` users can continue with configs unchanged, but
    users of the quickbar functions `xmobar` or `dzen` will need to
    change `xmonad.hs`: their types have changed to allow easier
    composition with other `XConfig` modifiers. The `dynamicLogDzen`
    and `dynamicLogXmobar` functions have been removed.

  * `WindowGo` or `safeSpawn` users may need to change command lines
    due to `safeSpawn` changes.

  * People explicitly referencing the "SP" scratchpad workspace should
    change it to "NSP" which is also used by the new
    `Util.NamedScratchpad` module.

  * (Optional) People who explicitly use `swapMaster` in key or mouse
    bindings should change it to `shiftMaster`. It's the current
    default used where `swapMaster` had been used previously. It works
    better than `swapMaster` when using floating and tiled windows
    together on the same workspace.
